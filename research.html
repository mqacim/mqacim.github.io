						<h3><b>Speech Emotion Recognition</b></h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/RnD/ser.png" alt="Speech Emotion Recognition" /></span>
							Speech signal contains the emotional state of a speaker along with the message. The recognition of the emotional state
							of a speaker helps in determining the true meaning of a message and allows for more natural communication between humans
							and machines. The design and development of a speech recognition system involves design and recording of a corpus, 
							analyzing different feature sets to discover most appropriate feature set, and determining best classification approaches.
							We designed and developed a corpus for speech emotion recognition for the Urdu language. The performance of
							frame-level features, utterance-level features, and spectrograms have been evaluated. Emotion recognition
							experiments have been conducted using classifiers including Support Vector Machine, Hidden Markov Models and
							Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results show that the utterance-level features outperform the frame-level
							features and spectrograms. The combined feature set of cepstral, spectral, prosodic, and voice quality features performs
							better than the individual feature sets. The unweighted average recalls of 84.1%, 80.2%, 84.7% have been achieved for
							speaker-dependent and speaker-independent and text-independent emotion recognition, respectively.

						<h3><b>Spoken Dialog System</b></h3>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/RnD/sds.png" alt="Spoken Dialog System" /></span>
							Speech-based services over simple mobile phones are a viable way of providing information-access to under-served
							populations (low-literate, low-income, tech-shy, handicapped, linguistic minority, marginalized). Despite the simplicity
							and flexibility of speech input, telephone-based information services commonly rely on push-button (DTMF) input. This is
							primarily because high accuracy automatic speech recognition (ASR), that is essential for an end-to-end spoken
							interaction, is not available for several languages in developing regions. We share findings from an HCI design
							intervention for a dialog system-based weather information service for farmers in Pakistan. We demonstrate that a high
							accuracy ASR alone is not sufficient for effective, inclusive speech interfaces. We present the details of the iterative
							improvement of the existing service that had low task success rate (37.8%) despite being based on a very high accuracy
							ASR (trained on target language speech data). Based on a deployment spanning 23,997 phone calls from 6893 users over 10
							months, we show that as multimodal input, user adaptation and context-specific help were added to supplement the ASR,
							the task success rate increased to 96.3%. Following this intervention, the service was made the national weather hotline
							of Pakistan.

							Speech interfaces provide people an easy and comfortable means to interact with computer systems. Speech recognition is
							a core component of speech interfaces which recognizes human speech in a particular language. We have recorded datasets 
							for the Urdu language related to different domains like weather information, travel reservation, etc. Automatic Speech 
							Recognition (ASR) systems for cities of Pakistan, numbers, dates, etc. have been developed. These ASR systems have been 
							used in spoken dialog systems to provide weather information and reserve bus seats for traveling.
